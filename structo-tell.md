# Structo TELL

## So, what is Structo TELL?

Structo’s version of [Hack&&Tell](http://hackandtell.org/). 

## Rules

Rules are more relaxed as our community is smaller. It is structured that <= 6 presenters give __5 minutes__ long presentations on something they built/learned, and then respond to Q&A for __3 minutes__.

We want to promote the projects and studies that people do in their spare time, for fun, or utility, and not the kinds of projects that are only applicable to people who work in the company. 
Who?

There’s no strict criteria on material, so anyone can share anything! Participation is optional.

## When?

We will be having this every (maybe alternate) Friday. Time: 5PM onwards.

## I’M IN! How do I register?

Just join the Slack Channel [__#tell__](https://structo3d.slack.com/messages/C7JRWLL5V/) ( <-- Click it ) and announce your participation (+ your topic). We have only 6 slots per event.

As for joining as audience, we will be sending an open invitation one week in advanced on Slack [__#general__](https://structo3d.slack.com/messages/C0CA0QLGH/) channel.

## Code of Conduct

Yes. We do have some CoC. Copied this from Recurse:

```
No feigning surprise

The first rule means you shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!") and non-technical things ("You don't know who RMS is?!"). Feigning surprise has absolutely no social or educational benefit: When people feign surprise, it's usually to make them feel better about themselves and others feel worse. And even when that's not the intention, it's almost always the effect. As you've probably already guessed, this rule is tightly coupled to our belief in the importance of people feeling comfortable saying "I don't know" and "I don't understand."
No well-actually's

A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation. This doesn't mean it isn't about truth-seeking or that we don't care about being precise. Almost all well-actually's in our experience are about grandstanding, not truth-seeking. 
No back-seat driving

If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn't intermittently lob advice across the room. This can lead to the "too many cooks" problem, but more important, it can be rude and disruptive to half-participate in a conversation. This isn't to say you shouldn't help, offer advice, or join conversations. On the contrary, we encourage all those things. Rather, it just means that when you want to help out or work with others, you should fully engage and not just butt in sporadically.
No subtle -isms

Our last social rule bans subtle racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias. This one is different from the rest, because it covers a class of behaviors instead of one very specific pattern.

Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. For example, saying "It's so easy my grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules, this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it's not a big deal to mess up – you just apologize and move on.
